# Spacesuit: Interzioncoin's implementation of cloaked transactions

This library provides a pure-Rust implementation of [Cloak][cloak], a confidential assets
protocol based on the [Bulletproofs][bp_website] zero-knowledge circuit proof system.

The implementation of the Cloak protocol for [Interzioncoin][interzioncoin] is called [Spacesuit][spacesuit_crate].
It uses [this implementation][bp_repo] of Bulletproofs circuit proofs in Rust.

## Documentation

Specs for the Cloak protocol can be [found here][cloak].

## WARNING

This code is still research-quality. It is not (yet) suitable for deployment.

## Tests 

Run tests with `cargo test`.

## Benchmarks

This crate uses [criterion.rs][criterion] for benchmarks. Run
benchmarks with `cargo bench`.

## About

This is a research project sponsored by [Interzioncoin][interzioncoin],
developed by Henry de Valence, Cathie Yun, and Oleg Andreev.

The Spacesuit repository was moved from [this location][old_repo] on 2/7/2019.
